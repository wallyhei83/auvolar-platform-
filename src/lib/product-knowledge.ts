DEEP PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE — AUVOLAR LED LIGHTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## OT Series — Area/Shoebox Light (FLAGSHIP)

### Why OT Series Wins:
- **3-in-1 CCT selectable** (3000K/4000K/5000K) — one SKU covers warm, neutral, and cool white. Contractors love this: no guessing, change CCT on-site with a DIP switch
- **3 optical distributions** (Type III, IV, V) — Type III for roadways/sidewalks, Type IV for parking lots, Type V for intersections/wide areas
- **Universal voltage** (100-277V standard, 277-480V HV option) — works on ANY electrical system
- **Without Driver (WD) option** — for customers who want to use their own driver or replace existing fixtures
- **3 sizes cover everything**: S (75-145W), M (180-230W), L (300-420W)

### Technical Details:
- Efficacy: up to 150 lm/W (industry-leading for area lights)
- IP66 waterproof, IK08 impact resistant
- Operating temp: -40°F to 122°F (-40°C to 50°C)
- Surge: 10kV/20kV
- 0-10V dimming standard
- Tool-less wiring compartment — saves 5-10 min per install
- DLC Premium listed — qualifies for maximum utility rebates
- Integrated photocell receptacle (NEMA 7-pin)

### Typical Applications:
- Parking lots: 150W replaces 400W HPS, saves $95/year/fixture
- Streets/roadways: Type III distribution for proper setback
- Commercial properties: Type V for even coverage
- Schools/campuses: 3000K warm white for pedestrian comfort
- Car dealerships: 5000K bright white to showcase vehicles

### Mounting Options:
- Arm mount (most common for poles)
- Slip fitter (for existing round tenons)
- Trunnion (for wall/surface mount)
- All included or low-cost adapter

### SKU Decoder: AOK-OT-[Watt]-[Voltage]-[Optic]-[CCT]
- AOK-OT-150W-NV-T3-40 = 150W, 100-277V, Type III, 4000K
- AOK-OT-300W-HV-T5-50 = 300W, 277-480V, Type V, 5000K

## PLB Series — Area/Shoebox Light (PREMIUM)

### Why PLB Series Stands Out:
- **Sleek, low-profile design** — modern aesthetic for high-end properties
- Wattages: 75W to 300W
- Same CCT selectable and optical options as OT
- **Lighter weight** than OT — easier install on existing poles
- Premium aluminum housing with powder coat finish

### Best For:
- Upscale retail centers, corporate campuses, HOA communities
- Properties where aesthetics matter as much as performance
- Municipal projects requiring modern look

---

## ISF Series — LED Stadium Light (PRO GRADE)

### Why ISF Series is Special:
- **Precision optics system** — 5° beam control eliminates light spill and glare
- **Modular design** — multiple fixtures on one crossarm for uniform coverage
- **TV broadcast quality** — CRI>80 with optional CRI>90 for HD broadcast
- **Zero uplight** — 100% forward throw, meets dark sky requirements
- **Anti-glare visor** standard on all models
- Wattages: 400W, 600W, 800W, 1000W, 1200W, 1500W, 1800W

### Beam Angles & When to Use:
- 15° — Narrow spot: long-throw for tall poles (100ft+), tennis courts from far mounts
- 25° — Medium: football fields, baseball outfields, soccer
- 40° — General flood: most common for multi-sport, basketball, volleyball
- 60° — Wide flood: pools, skating rinks, general recreation
- 90° — Very wide: low-mount applications, close-range flood
- Asymmetric — For borders/sideline areas, reduces spill to neighbors

### Mounting Types:
- Type A (Yoke): most versatile, adjustable aim
- Type B (Slip fitter): for round pole tenons
- Type C (Trunnion): for wall/bracket mount  
- Type D (Bracket): heavy-duty structural mount

### Key Selling Points:
- Replaces 1500W-5000W metal halide
- Instant on/off (no 15-min warmup like MH)
- 60-70% energy savings
- No re-strike delay — if power flickers, lights come right back
- Designed for 25+ year lifespan
- 110 IES files available for photometric design
- FREE lighting layout service for stadium projects

### Common Projects:
- High school football: 6-8 poles, typically 1000-1500W per pole = $25K-$45K
- Tennis courts (4): 4-8 fixtures, 600W each = $6K-$10K
- Baseball fields: 6-8 poles, 1200-1800W = $30K-$60K
- Soccer fields: 4-6 poles, 1000-1500W = $20K-$40K
- Parking structures: wall-mount with anti-glare

## INS Series — Sports Flood Light (EXTREME DUTY)

### Why INS Series for Harsh Environments:
- **IP67** — fully submersible rated (not just splash proof)
- **IK10** — maximum impact resistance, vandal proof
- **Marine-grade coating** — designed for coastal salt air
- Wattages: 315W, 400W, 480W, 600W, 720W
- 7 beam angles per wattage for precise aiming

### Best For:
- Coastal installations (salt corrosion resistance)
- Public parks with vandalism risk
- Correctional facilities
- Mining/industrial outdoor areas
- Any project requiring maximum durability
