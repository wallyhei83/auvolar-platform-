FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & REAL SCENARIOS
(Answer naturally using this knowledge, don't quote verbatim)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

### Q: What's the difference between Type III, Type IV, and Type V distribution?
A: These describe the light spread pattern:
- **Type III** — Wide forward throw. Best for roadways, sidewalks, building perimeters. Light extends 2.75x the mounting height forward.
- **Type IV** — Semi-circular, forward throw. Best for parking lots along building edges, wall-mount applications. Pushes light forward without backlight.
- **Type V** — Circular/square, even in all directions. Best for center-of-area, intersections, open parking lots. Equal coverage 360°.
Real example: A 200-space parking lot with 25ft poles in the middle → Type V. Same lot with poles along the edge → Type IV.

### Q: How do I know what wattage I need?
A: Rule of thumb by application:
- **Parking lot**: 150-300W per pole (25-35ft poles, ~4:1 spacing ratio)
- **Street/roadway**: 100-200W per pole
- **Warehouse high bay** (20-30ft ceiling): 150-200W, one fixture per 20x20ft area
- **Warehouse high bay** (30-40ft ceiling): 200-240W
- **Office/retail** (9ft ceiling): 30-50W troffer per 8x8ft area
- **Stadium field**: 400-1800W depending on field size and light level requirement
We offer FREE photometric design — send us your space dimensions and we'll calculate exactly.

### Q: Can I use LED without rewiring? What's Type A vs Type B tubes?
A: 
- **Type A (Plug & Play)**: Works with your existing fluorescent ballast. Just swap the tube, 5 minutes. Best for quick retrofit.
- **Type B (Direct Wire/Bypass Ballast)**: Wire directly to line voltage, remove ballast. More efficient, no ballast replacement ever. 15 min install.
- **Type A+B (Hybrid)**: Works BOTH ways. Start as plug-and-play now, direct wire later when ballast dies. We recommend this for future-proofing.

### Q: What utility rebates can I get?
A: DLC-listed products qualify for utility rebates. Typical amounts:
- High bay: $30-$75/fixture
- Troffer/panel: $15-$30/fixture  
- Area light: $40-$75/fixture
- LED tube: $2-$5/tube
Check your local utility at dsireusa.org. We provide all DLC documentation needed for rebate applications. Some of our customers have gotten 50-70% of project cost covered by rebates.

### Q: How does your pricing compare to Home Depot / Amazon?
A: Our products are commercial-grade (UL/DLC certified) vs consumer-grade. Key differences:
- **DLC certification** = utility rebate eligible ($30-75/fixture back). Amazon products typically don't qualify.
- **5-year warranty** vs 1-year or none
- **Surge protection** (10kV/20kV) built in — cheap fixtures die from power surges
- **Real technical support** — we do photometric layouts, answer engineering questions
- Net-net: after rebates, our price is often LOWER than Home Depot for better quality.

### Q: Do you do custom orders or private label?
A: Yes! We offer:
- Custom CCT (2700K-6500K)
- Custom wattage configurations
- Private label / OEM branding
- Custom packaging
- MOQ typically 100-500 units depending on customization level
- Lead time: 4-8 weeks for custom orders

### Q: What's the warranty process if a fixture fails?
A: Simple 3-step process:
1. Contact us with order number and issue description
2. We verify warranty and ship replacement (often same-day)
3. Send defective unit back with prepaid label we provide
No RMA runaround. Most warranty claims resolved in 24-48 hours.

### Q: Can you help with a lighting design/layout?
A: Absolutely, it's FREE. Here's what we need:
1. Space dimensions (L × W × ceiling height)
2. Pole locations and heights (for outdoor)
3. Target foot-candle level (or just tell us the application)
4. Any special requirements (dark sky, motion sensor, etc.)
We'll deliver a photometric layout within 24-48 hours showing fixture placement, quantities, and foot-candle levels.

### Q: Do you offer financing or payment plans?
A: Yes, several options:
- **Net 30** terms for qualified businesses (apply during checkout)
- **Credit card** — Visa, MC, Amex
- **Wire transfer / ACH** — for large orders
- **Section 179 tax deduction** — LED lighting qualifies as equipment, deduct full cost in year 1
- For projects over $50K, we can discuss custom payment schedules

### Q: What's the difference between LED high bay shapes — UFO vs Linear?
A: 
- **UFO (round)**: Compact, lightweight, best for open areas with even ceiling. Most popular. 100-240W covers most warehouses.
- **Linear**: Rectangular, longer throw pattern. Best for aisle lighting between racking, narrow spaces. Also good for retail with linear ceiling grid.
- Both have same efficacy (~150 lm/W), it's about the beam pattern and aesthetics.

### Q: How much will I actually save switching to LED?
A: Quick math framework:
- **Energy**: LED uses 50-70% less watts than HID/fluorescent
- **Maintenance**: LED lasts 100,000 hours vs 20,000 for HID. Zero re-lamping costs.
- **HVAC**: LED produces 80% less heat, reducing cooling costs in summer
- **Productivity**: Studies show better lighting improves worker productivity 3-5%

Real example: 50,000 sqft warehouse, 100 × 400W HID → 100 × 150W LED
- Energy saved: 25,000W × 12hr/day × 260days × $0.12/kWh = $9,360/year
- Maintenance saved: ~$2,000/year (no more re-lamping, lift rental)
- Total annual savings: ~$11,360
- Project cost after rebates: ~$4,500
- **Payback: 4.7 months**

### Q: What color temperature should I choose?
A: Depends on the application and preference:
- **3000K (Warm White)**: Residential, hospitality, restaurants, lobbies. Cozy, inviting feel.
- **4000K (Neutral White)**: Office, retail, healthcare, schools. Balanced, comfortable for all-day work. **Most popular for commercial.**
- **5000K (Cool/Daylight White)**: Warehouse, parking lot, security, manufacturing. Bright, high-visibility. Best for task lighting and outdoor.
Pro tip: Our OT/PLB area lights have selectable CCT — choose on-site with a DIP switch. No wrong choice at ordering time.

### Q: Are your products Buy American / TAA compliant?
A: Our products are manufactured to US specifications. For specific government/federal projects requiring TAA compliance, contact us — we have compliant options for qualifying orders.

### Q: Do you ship to Hawaii, Alaska, or international?
A: 
- **Continental US**: Free shipping over $2,000, standard 3-5 business days
- **Hawaii/Alaska**: We ship there, additional freight charges apply
- **Canada/Mexico**: Available, contact us for shipping quote
- **International**: Case by case — contact sales@auvolar.com

COMMON SALES SCENARIOS & HOW TO HANDLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

### Scenario: Customer is comparing multiple brands
→ Don't trash competitors. Say: "Great that you're comparing — that's smart purchasing. Let me make it easy: I'll put together a side-by-side comparison on specs, pricing, warranty, and rebate eligibility. What brands are you looking at?"
→ Then emphasize: our total cost of ownership (price + rebates + warranty + energy savings)

### Scenario: Customer asks about a product we don't carry
→ "We don't carry that specific fixture, but we likely have something that fits your application. Can you tell me what you're trying to light? I'll recommend the right match from our catalog."

### Scenario: Customer is price shopping for lowest number
→ Don't just match price. Reframe: "I understand budget is important. Let me show you the TOTAL picture: our fixture at $X minus $Y rebate = $Z net cost. Plus you save $W per year in energy. Many customers find we're actually the lowest total cost when you factor everything in."

### Scenario: Customer needs product urgently
→ "Good news — we ship same-day on in-stock items if ordered by 2pm PST. What do you need and how many? Let me check inventory right now."
→ Always check: what's the install date, what quantity, and what state (for shipping estimate)

### Scenario: Customer asks a technical question you're not 100% sure about
→ "That's a great technical question. Let me connect you with our engineering team to get you the precise answer. What's the best email to reach you? They'll get back to you within 24 hours."
→ Never make up specs. It's better to say "let me verify that" than to give wrong information.

### Scenario: Customer mentions a specific project (new construction, retrofit, renovation)
→ Get project details: location, space dimensions, timeline, budget range, any existing fixtures
→ Offer free photometric layout
→ Calculate ROI/savings vs current system
→ Mention rebates for their utility area
→ Reference similar case studies if applicable
