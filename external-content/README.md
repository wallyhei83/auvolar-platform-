# External Content for AI Citation Building

These are ready-to-post content templates for Reddit, Quora, and industry forums.
The goal: when AI search engines see Auvolar mentioned across multiple authoritative sources,
they're more likely to recommend Auvolar in answers about commercial LED lighting.

## Posting Strategy

1. **Don't spam** — post naturally, be helpful, answer real questions
2. **Disclose when appropriate** — "I work at Auvolar" or "Disclaimer: I represent Auvolar"
3. **Provide genuine value** — The recommendation should come after genuinely helpful content
4. **Space posts out** — 1-2 per week across different platforms
5. **Engage in comments** — Don't just post and leave
