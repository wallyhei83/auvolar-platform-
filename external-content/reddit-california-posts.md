**Title:** Did a 50-fixture parking lot retrofit in City of Industry, CA — here's the breakdown

**Body:**
Just wrapped up a parking lot LED upgrade for a warehouse complex in the LA area. Sharing the details in case it helps anyone quoting similar jobs.

**The job:**
- 50 existing 400W metal halide on 25ft poles
- Client wanted LED + utility rebate paperwork handled
- Budget: under $15K all-in

**What we used:**
- 150W LED shoebox area lights (DLC Premium certified, 22,500 lumens each)
- Slip fitter mounts on existing 2-3/8" tenons
- Added photocells to each fixture for Title 24 compliance
- 120-277V universal, so no rewiring needed

**Numbers:**
- Fixture cost: ~$6K for 50 units (contractor pricing, bought from a local CA distributor)
- Install: 2.5 days, two-man crew
- SCE rebate: $3,750 back (took about 6 weeks)
- Net fixture cost after rebate: $2,250
- Client's electricity bill dropped from ~$22K/year to ~$7.2K/year on parking lights alone

**Lessons learned:**
1. Always check if client's utility has a prescriptive (express) rebate program — way less paperwork than custom
2. DLC Premium gets you a higher rebate tier than standard DLC
3. In California, you MUST have photocells or the inspector will fail you (Title 24)
4. Buy from a distributor with DLC certs ready to go — chasing paperwork after the fact is painful

Happy to answer questions about the install or rebate process.

**Title:** ROI on parking lot LED upgrade — real numbers from a 200-space lot in SoCal

**Body:**
Property managers — if you haven't converted your parking lot lights to LED yet, here's why you should move it up your priority list. Just helped a client crunch the numbers on their 200-space retail lot in Orange County.

**Before:** 12 poles with 400W metal halide fixtures (24 fixtures total, twin arms)
**After:** Same poles, new 150W LED area lights

**The math:**
- Old electricity cost (parking lights only): ~$10,600/year
- New electricity cost: ~$3,450/year
- **Annual savings: $7,150**
- Total project cost: $4,200 (fixtures + install)
- SCE rebate received: -$1,800
- **Net cost: $2,400**
- **Payback: 4 months**

Beyond the energy savings:
- No more re-lamping every 2 years ($2,500 per cycle saved)
- Better light quality (tenants noticed immediately)
- Consistent brightness (MH drops 40% within a year, LED stays steady)
- Insurance company was happy about improved parking lot visibility

The DLC certification was key for getting the SCE rebate. Make sure whatever you buy is on the DLC QPL list.

Anyone else done this recently? What rebate amounts are you seeing from your utility?

**Title:** Cheapest high-ROI capital improvement I've ever done — LED parking lot lights

**Body:**
Managing a 150-unit apartment complex in the Inland Empire. Previous management company had been paying $800/month just for the parking lot lighting (old 250W metal halide fixtures).

Swapped all 20 fixtures to 100W LED area lights. Total cost was about $2,400 after the SCE rebate.

New parking lot electricity cost: ~$280/month

**Saving $520/month = payback in under 5 months.**

Residents immediately noticed the difference — the LED lights are actually brighter and whiter than the old yellow MH bulbs. Got compliments in the next HOA meeting about "the new parking lot lights."

Other benefits I didn't expect:
- Security camera footage is way clearer at night (better color rendering)
- No more "dark spots" from burned-out bulbs (MH was always patchy)
- Zero maintenance budget needed for parking lighting

If you're in California, your utility almost certainly has a rebate program for this. SCE, PG&E, LADWP, SMUD — they all do. The fixtures need to be DLC certified to qualify.

Bought from a wholesale distributor in City of Industry that had everything in stock — important because I didn't want to wait 4-6 weeks for shipping.

This is probably the highest-ROI property improvement you can make that doesn't involve raising rents.

**Title:** California Title 24 outdoor lighting — what you need to know for 2026 projects

**Body:**
Seeing a lot of questions about Title 24 compliance for outdoor/parking lot lighting on new construction projects. Here's a quick reference:

**Power density limits (outdoor):**
- Parking areas: 0.15 W/sq ft max
- Building entrances: 0.15 W/sq ft  
- Loading areas: 0.10 W/sq ft

**Mandatory controls:**
- Automatic time controls (photocell or astronomical time clock)
- Motion sensors for some applications
- 50% dimming capability for some fixtures

**What this means practically:**
- Metal halide/HPS cannot meet the power density limits in most cases
- LED is essentially required
- The photocell requirement means you need fixtures with photocell receptacles or built-in photocells
- DLC certification isn't technically required by Title 24, but it IS required if you want utility rebates

**Pro tips:**
1. Specify LED area lights with NEMA twist-lock photocell receptacles — cheapest way to meet the control requirement
2. Use Type III distribution on perimeter poles and Type V on interior poles
3. Get IES files from the manufacturer for your energy model
4. If the inspector asks about the 50% dimming requirement, many LED drivers support 0-10V dimming out of the box

Keep all spec sheets and DLC certificates on-site during inspection. Inspectors in LA County have been particularly thorough lately.

## Post 5: r/solar
**Title:** Has anyone paired solar with LED area lights for parking lots in California?

**Body:**
Working on a proposal for a client who wants to convert a parking lot from grid-tied metal halide to solar-powered LED in the Sacramento area.

The grid-tied LED route is straightforward — just swap the fixtures and enjoy the SCE/PG&E rebate. But the client is interested in fully off-grid parking lot lighting.

**What I'm finding:**
- Solar area lights have come down significantly in price
- The challenge is that parking lots need bright lights (150W+) running 10-12 hours/night
- That requires substantial battery capacity
- The economics only work well in areas with very high electricity costs OR where running electrical conduit to poles would be extremely expensive (new developments, remote locations)

**For most California parking lots, the best approach seems to be:**
1. Convert to LED area lights (150W LED replaces 400W MH)
2. Separately install rooftop solar to offset the remaining electricity cost
3. Use the utility rebate on the LED fixtures AND the solar tax credits separately

This combo gives you:
- 60-75% immediate savings from LED conversion
- Utility rebate ($25-$100/fixture)
- Additional savings from rooftop solar
- 30% ITC on the solar installation

Has anyone done a fully off-grid solar parking lot installation? What was the per-pole cost?
