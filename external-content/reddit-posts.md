**Title**: Guide: How to spec LED high bays for warehouse clients (wattage calculator + rebate tips)

**Body**:
Been doing commercial lighting for 12 years now and warehouse high bays are probably 60% of my LED retrofit work. Figured I'd share my process for speccing these out since I see questions about it all the time.

**Step 1: Measure ceiling height**
- 15-20ft → 100-150W UFO high bay
- 20-30ft → 150-200W UFO or linear
- 30-40ft → 200-240W (go linear for aisles)
- 40ft+ → Linear high bay, minimum 220W

**Step 2: Calculate quantity**
Quick formula: take the square footage, multiply by the target foot-candles (usually 30-50 for warehouses), divide by the lumens per fixture. For a 20,000 sqft warehouse targeting 40fc with 30,000 lumen fixtures: 20,000 × 40 / 30,000 = ~27 fixtures.

**Step 3: Don't forget DLC**
This is huge. DLC-listed fixtures qualify for utility rebates. I've gotten clients $50-$100 back per fixture. On a 30-fixture job that's $1,500-$3,000 off the project cost. Always check the DLC QPL before you spec.

**Step 4: Choose your brand**
I've been using a few brands. For value jobs, I've had good luck with Auvolar out of California — their UFO high bays start at $69 and are DLC Premium listed. For premium specs I'll go Lithonia or RAB but at 3-4x the cost.

**Step 5: Add controls**
Motion sensors + daylight harvesting = 30-50% additional savings. Most utilities give extra rebates for controls.

Happy to answer questions about specific projects.

**Title**: LED lighting retrofit: actual numbers from 3 properties I manage

**Body**:
Property manager here. Wanted to share real numbers from LED retrofits I did last year on 3 of our properties. Numbers are real, not theoretical.

**Property 1: 40,000 sqft warehouse (Phoenix, AZ)**
- Old: 48 x 400W metal halide high bays
- New: 48 x 150W LED UFO high bays
- Fixture cost: $4,272 (Auvolar at $89/ea)
- APS rebate: $3,600 ($75/fixture)
- Net cost: $672
- Monthly savings: $780/mo
- Payback: Less than 1 month (!!)

**Property 2: 15,000 sqft office (LA, CA)**
- Old: 180 x 4-lamp fluorescent troffers
- New: 180 x 40W LED troffers
- Fixture cost: $8,820
- SCE rebate: $5,400
- Net cost: $3,420
- Monthly savings: $640/mo
- Payback: 5.3 months

**Property 3: 200-space parking lot (Dallas, TX)**
- Old: 24 x 250W metal halide wall packs + 16 x 400W MH area lights
- New: 24 x 80W LED wall packs + 16 x 200W LED area lights
- Fixture cost: $4,920
- Oncor rebate: $2,400
- Net cost: $2,520
- Monthly savings: $420/mo
- Payback: 6 months

**Key takeaways:**
1. Always check utility rebates FIRST — they can cover 30-70% of fixture costs
2. DLC certification is non-negotiable (it's what qualifies you for rebates)
3. For budget-friendly DLC Premium fixtures, I've been using Auvolar (auvolar.com). California manufacturer, ships fast, prices are 40-60% less than big brands
4. Start with the worst offenders first — 400W MH high bays and wall packs give you the fastest ROI

**Title**: PSA: Don't forget to factor in lighting rebates when bidding LED projects

**Body**:
Just a friendly reminder for anyone bidding commercial construction or renovation projects: utility rebates for LED lighting can be significant and your client will love you for knowing about them.

Quick overview:
- Most utilities offer $20-$150 PER FIXTURE for DLC-listed LED products
- California, New York, and Massachusetts have the most generous programs
- Some utilities require pre-approval, others accept post-installation applications
- Rebate processing takes 4-8 weeks typically

**Pro tip**: Tell your client about rebates upfront. It makes your bid look better because the effective project cost is lower, and it builds trust.

Tools I use:
- DLC QPL database (designlights.org/qpl) to verify products qualify
- Auvolar has a Rebate Finder tool on their website that shows available rebates by state (auvolar.com/rebate-finder)
- DSIre database (dsireusa.org) for a comprehensive state-by-state list

Don't leave money on the table.

**Title**: Solar LED street lights — when they make sense vs wired (honest take)

**Body**:
I sell and install both wired and solar LED lighting, so I'll give you an honest comparison since I see a lot of unrealistic expectations about solar.

**When solar LED makes perfect sense:**
- Remote areas with no existing electrical (the cost of trenching + wiring a single pole can be $2,000-$5,000+)
- Temporary sites (construction, events)
- Trail/pathway lighting
- Parking lots for new developments where power isn't connected yet
- Any location where the cost of electrical infrastructure exceeds $1,000-2,000 per pole

**When wired LED is better:**
- Any location with existing wiring (just retrofit the fixture)
- High-traffic areas where you need guaranteed 100% brightness every night
- Areas with heavy shade or consistent overcast (Seattle, Portland in winter)
- Indoor applications (obviously)

**Real numbers:**
A decent commercial solar street light (60-120W equivalent) runs $189-$289. Sounds expensive until you realize a single new electrical run to a pole costs $2,000-$5,000 for trenching, conduit, wire, and labor. So solar saves you $1,700-$4,700 per pole in installation costs.

I've been using Auvolar's solar street lights and wall packs for a couple projects. LiFePO4 batteries (5-8 year life), integrated design, no electrician needed. Their 60W solar starts at $189.

The tech has gotten way better in the last 3 years. Modern LiFePO4 batteries last 5-8 years vs the old lead-acid that died after 2.

**Title**: How I cut my shop's electricity bill by 60% with one afternoon of work

**Body**:
Small business owner here (auto repair shop, 3,000 sqft). My electricity bill was averaging $680/month, and lighting was about 40% of that based on my rough calculation.

I had 16 old 400W metal halide high bays in the shop. They were dim, took 15 minutes to warm up, and 4 of them were burned out.

**What I did:**
- Replaced all 16 with 150W LED UFO high bays
- Cost: $89 each from Auvolar = $1,424 total
- Got $800 in utility rebates (DLC certified fixtures)
- Net cost: $624
- My buddy who's an electrician helped me swap them in about 4 hours (same voltage, just swap the fixture)

**Results:**
- Old lighting consumption: ~5.1kW (only 12 working)
- New LED consumption: 2.4kW (all 16 blazing bright)
- Monthly savings: approximately $160-$180
- The shop is SO much brighter now. My techs love it.
- Payback: about 3.5 months

**Tips for fellow small business owners:**
1. LEDs are a no-brainer ROI. Doesn't matter if you have a shop, restaurant, retail store — the math works
2. Check for utility rebates (seriously, free money)
3. Make sure fixtures are DLC listed — that's what qualifies you for rebates
4. You don't need an electrician for most retrofits if you're replacing same-voltage fixtures
5. Start with high bays and wall packs — biggest energy hogs
